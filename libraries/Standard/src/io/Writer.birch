 *    Writer <|-- YAMLWriter
 *    YAMLWriter <|-- JSONWriter
 *    link Writer "../Writer/"
 *    link YAMLWriter "../YAMLWriter/"
 *    link JSONWriter "../JSONWriter/"
 * ```
 *
 * Typical use is to use the `Writer` factory function to instantiate an
 * object of an appropriate derived class based on the file extension of the
 * given path:
 *
 *     let writer <- make_writer(path);
 *
 * The whole contents of the file can be written at once with:
 *
 *     writer.dump(buffer);
 *
 * Alternatively, where the root element of the file is an array, the contents
 * may be written sequentially, one element at a time:
 *
 *     writer.push(buffer1);
 *     writer.push(buffer2);
 *     writer.push(buffer3);
 *
 * Finally, close the file:
 *
 *     writer.close();
 *
 * A file may not be valid for reading until the writer is closed, depending
 * on the file format.
